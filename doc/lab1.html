<h1>CS-220, Lab Assignment #1</h1>

<h2>Due Date: Friday 2009/09/04 - 9:00PM</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will begin working with the tools you will be using
to create your projects this semester.</p>

<p>Create a new directory and copy the files <a 
href="cfile.c">cfile.c</a>
and <a 
href="asmfile.s">asmfile.s</a>,
 into it.  Then, download the
<a 
href="Makefile">Makefile</a>
 which will compile the c file to
assembly, assembles both assembly files into object files and then links
these two object files into an executable (each as separate steps).</p>

<p>Run the command "make", which will use this Makefile to build this
project.  Run the program it creates, called "lab1", and look at the
output.  It should look like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>From ASM: 48
From C: 48
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now, use the lab submission page (linked from the main labs page) to 
submit the files, as detailed below (under "Submission:").  The page it 
gives you will list what files have been submitted, be sure all the 
required files are there, and don't submit any files that are NOT 
required.  Once you have submitted your project, you should see a page 
listing the files you have uploaded.  Show this to the TA to be sure you
 
have correctly submitted your project.</p>

<p><b>Be sure the TA notes that you have correctly submitted this.  This
 
will be part of your grade.</b></p>

<p>You will need to use your CS LDAP account to access this system.  If 
you are not officially registered for this course, this will not work, 
and you will need to do this last part on your own before the due date 
once you are registered.  If you can't get registered in time, send me 
(Prof. Greene) an e-mail with your full name and B-Number and I will 
temporarily manually add permission for you to submit projects until you
 
are officially enrolled.</p>

<h3>Submission:</h3>

Submit your single .s file, .c file, and Makefile using the online
submission form in the labs section of the webpage before 9:00PM Friday
night.  Do not submit object (.o) files or executables, and do not
submit the assembly file that your Makefile created (cfile.s), only the
one that was a source (asmfile.s).  If you have problems, ask the lab
instructor for assistance, or send e-mail to the instructor, to the TA,
or to the mailing list.<p>
